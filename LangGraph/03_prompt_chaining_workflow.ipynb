Enterprise knowledge management (EKM) refers to the processes and systems used to capture, organize, store, retrieve, and share knowledge and information within an organization. However, EKM faces numerous challenges, including the complexity of knowledge assets, the difficulty of capturing and sharing tacit knowledge, and the need for effective decision-making and risk management. To address these challenges, organizations have been seeking innovative approaches to improve their EKM practices.\n",
